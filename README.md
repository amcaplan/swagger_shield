# SwaggerShield

Tired of getting weird errors when users (or your own clients) submit random
junk to your Rails API?  `SwaggerShield` is here to save the day!

## Usage

```ruby
# You can add to any controller, or to ApplicationController if you want
# SwaggerShield to protect your whole app.
class ApplicationController < ActionController::API
  SwaggerShield.protect!(
    self,

    # replace with the location of your actual swagger YAML file:
    swagger_file: File.join('config', 'swagger.yml'),

    # add on any valid "if" or "unless" conditionals that can be applied to a
    # Rails before_action
    if: -> { current_user.test_user? },
    unless: -> { params[:skip_swagger_shield] }
  )
end
```

Now, everything will work as before, as long as the requests are properly
formatted.  But if requests don't match your Swagger spec:

![You Shall Not Pass!](https://i0.wp.com/gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/you-shall-not-pass-gandalf-lotr.gif)

OK, maybe it's not that dramatic.  But your client will see an error pointing to
exactly what they messed up in the request:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "422",
      "detail": "The property '#/widget/price' of type string did not match the following type: integer",
      "source": {
        "pointer": "#/widget/price"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

(Only errors in JSON API format are supported, hopefully that'll be updated
soon...)

## Warning!

This project is under active development, being built up in stages as bits
become necessary for projects that make money.  So there's still plenty of stuff
to implement; use at your own risk.

That said, the project will gratefully accept the implementation of new types,
better error messaging, etc., basically anything you find useful in your own
work which seems generally applicable.  So please [contribute](#development)!
